# A README template mandatory for inner-source repos and optional for everyone else

### Instructions for how to use:

1. On your personal developer.nasa.gov/<username> page or the initial developer.nasa.gov page, click the big green button that says "NEW". This will start a new repository.
  
2. You'll see an option at top of the page that appears now that says "Repository Template", click the button below that says "no template" and select from the drop down <b>meta/README_template</b>. 

3. When you start your new repository, it willl initially populate with this README. Click the edit button in upper left when you see your repository for the first time. This will start to edit the README.md markdown file. 

4. Delete these instructions and makes changes as appropriate for your project!

NOTE: If you're using this as a guide to modify an existing repository, it is easier to fork, select edit, and then copy and paste out the text in markdown form into your existing markdown.

<i>The upper sections of this README are mandatory for official software reuse according to NPR 7150.2C and the NASA Software Engineering Handbook. The lower sections are good information to include for almost any repository. </i>

# Title of the Repository
<i>The name of the repository & softare project.</i>

## Description
<i> Please include a description of the software project. This should be 1-10 sentences and give someone who has no knowledge of your project a good idea of what it does and why you think it has value and should exist.</i>


### The Civil Servant Software Technical Point of Contact for the software product. 
<i>It is required to include the name and email of the civil servant who is the technical point of contact for the software project. This person may be writing code or the project owner. </i>

## Language(s) used by the software
<i>Example might be "Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS". If possible keep on one line, separate with commas, and put in order of amount of code. Theoretically in the future this information might be extracted in bulk across all similar READMEs.</i>


## License information for any code dependencies
<!--
The actual language from NPR 7150.2C is "Any third party code contained therein, and the record of the requisite license or permission received from the third party permitting the Governmentâ€™s use, if applicable."
-->
<!-- 
There are a different ways to fulfull this. The most straight forward way is to (1) confirm each of your dependencies has a license that allows you to use it (2) make a requirements.txt file or another file type depending on the code language that shows all your dependencies. 
EXAMPLE: 
-->
Confirming the proper licenses exist is a requirement both to share and use any code.

You can find all the dependencies for this repository this repository's file for dependency management. This may be a requirements.txt file if Python or package.json if JavaScript. If this type of file doesn't exist, any dependencies will be listed in this README.md file. The authors of this repository have confirmed each has an open-source licenses suitable for government use. You should confirm this as well by either looking in the files for that dependency or looking up the dependency in the appropriate package directory.

## Requests if used by people who are not the author
<!-- example text-->
If you find this repository useful, even a little, please fork or star thee repository! It provides positive feedback to the developer as well as helpful analytics data to the platform maintainers. If whether you can reuse code is in any way unclear, please reach out to code repository author / point of contact.

## Organization of code contributors & project owners
<i>Please put an organization name here that is meaningful. Often organization at certain centers are known by your code. The problem with just listing that by itself is it is often meaningless to anyone not at your center. If the code project involves work by more than one team or there was a main team and then others joined, pleaes describe that here.</i>

## Contractor Author Point of Content
<i>If the author(s) of the code are contractors, it may be appropriate to list their names and/or email in addition to the civil servant point of contact</i>

## Installation Instructions
<i>Please include instructions for how a newbie to your project could install it.</i>

## How to Use
<i>Please include instructions for how a newbie to your project could use it. This might be a demo, tutorial, or simply list of instructions.</i>
